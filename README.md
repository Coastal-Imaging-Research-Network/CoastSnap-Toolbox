# CoastSnap Community Beach Monitoring ToolBox

This toolbox was written by Dr. Mitchell Harley at the University of New South Wales (Australia). Please refer to the [publication in Coastal Engineering](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378383918304551) for further information.

## Getting Started

1.  [Download the CoastSnap Starters Toolkit](https://unsw-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/z2273773_ad_unsw_edu_au/Ed2R-hnWdytDm-Ya94DCG0MBUBJbiaGZkR5em16g8weODg?e=V10fsx) and unzip contents to your local directory. This directory will be your BASE_PATH (needed for step 3)

2.  Download the MATLAB files of this GitHub site to the CoastSnap/Code directory

3.  Make sure you have the following Matlab toolkits installed: mapping toolbox, Statistics and ML toolbox, Image processing toolbox

4.  Update the following two files to match your local setup: CSPsetPaths.m and CSPloadPaths.m

Thats all - you should now be up and running

## Setting up a new CoastSnap station

Setting up a new CoastSnap station requires two steps:

1.  In the **Images** directory, create a copy of **create_newsitename_here** and rename it to your sitename (e.g. *nthnarrabn*, *manly*).

2.  In the **CoastSnapDB.xlsx** (found in the **Database** folder), create a new tab with the *exact* name as your sitename above. It is best to copy an existing tab like **manly** as the structure of this needs to be identical.

## Inserting relevant station metadata

To be added

## Managing images using the CoastSnap Database

All new images from various the sources (e.g. Instagram, Facebook, Email) are to be saved to the **Raw** folder for each respective station.
